# 8086 Hardware-Level Transaction Simulator

## Overview
This project simulates a basic transaction system using 8086 Assembly,
focusing on how low-level hardware operations can be used to enforce
atomicity and consistency.

The project was built as part of a computer organization study to
understand instruction execution, memory usage, and interrupts.

## Core Concepts
- Register-level data movement
- Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)
- Stack management
- Atomic execution using controlled interrupts

## What This Project Demonstrates
- Comfort with low-level programming
- Understanding of hardware-software interaction
- Ability to reason about correctness at the instruction level

## Environment
- 8086 Assembly
- Emu8086 / DOSBox-style environment
